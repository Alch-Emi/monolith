//! A framework for the asynchronous download of recursive web assets
//!
//! This module contains two important elements: the trait [Resource] and the
//! struct [Asset].  A resource is effectively a parser for a certain type of
//! thing that might be found on the web.  Resources expose dependent [Asset]s,
//! which are any kind of web thing that is needed the finish parsing or
//! rendering that resource.  An Asset is primarily just a URL and a mime type
//! to hint at the kind of parser it needs.  However, it offers a method to
//! download itself, which creates and downloads a resource and attaches it to
//! the Asset.
//!
//! The end result of this process is a workflow that looks like this:
//!
//!  1. Create an asset with a MIME type and URL
//!  2. Download that asset
//!  3. List the assets needed to render the original Asset
//!  4. Download each of those assets (and repeat)
//!  5. Render original Asset (this calls the [Resource::render] method of the
//!     underlying Resource, which presumably then renders its subordinate
//!     Assets)

///  4. Download child [Asset]s
///  5. Use the now complete [Resource], discarding the Asset
///
/// The implementation of Asset contains several utility methods to aid this
/// process, most importantly, steps 3 and 4.
